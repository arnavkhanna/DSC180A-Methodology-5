**What is the most interesting topic covered in your domain this quarter?**  
Survivorship bias is the most interesting topic covered in my domain this quarter. I recently saw an example of it come up in the context of the NFL, which I'm very interested in, and being able to understand it made me a bit proud of myself.  
<br>
**Describe a potential investigation you would like to pursue for your Quarter 2 Project.**  
One potential investigation I would like to pursue is being able to mathematically prove causality between some human action and climate change.  
<br>
**What is a potential change youâ€™d make to the approach taken in your current Quarter 1 Project?**  
One change I would make is to moreso do as we go and not do so much planning. I believe that planning can only take one so far and beyond that, mistakes will come up while doing, so it's best to do, make mistakes, and account for mistakes while doing as opposed to planning for mistakes that might come up.  
<br>
**What other techniques would you be interested in using in your project?**  
I'd be most interested in learning new methods to establish causality and potentially be able to create a model that forecasts climate change due to certain human actions.
